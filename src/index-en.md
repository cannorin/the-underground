## FAQ

### Q. What's this?

### Q. Can I upload photos/videos to Twitter etc?

A. You can't, until you read the in-world description about this topic.

### Q. I noticed some people have a logo in their avatar. How can I also use it?

A. The logo is published under the following license:

> The glyphs “地下 The Underground” (c) by T. Suwa ([@bd_gfngfn](https://twitter.com/bd_gfngfn))

In a nutshell: You can change the color and place the glyphs ("地下 The Underground") as you like, but you are *not* allowed to edit the glyphs. Note that the ring part is not considered as a glyph.
