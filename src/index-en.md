## FAQ

### Q. What genre of music will be played?

A. We do *not* guarantee you can enjoy (what you consider) some kind of music.
That being said, we, as the name suggests, tend to do underground / experimental musics:

* Underground hardcore musics such as Frenchcore and Hardtek
* Algorave events with Sonic Pi, TidalCycles. etc
* *TECHNO*
* Whatever we like

### Q. What I can expect in the club other than music?

A. We have free drinks (virtual) and nice sofas (virtual).

### Q. When is the next gig?

A. Refer to [tw:@cannorin_vrc](https://twitter.com/cannorin_vrc). All times are in JST (UTC+9).

### Q. How to join?

A. We open the instance with Friends+, so if you have friends already in the club you also can join. Feel free to friend vrc:cannorin if it's not the case.

### Q. I want to have a gig!

A. Join https://discord.gg/43P7Um6 !

Note that it's a server for performers and we don't have a "lounge" server.
If you want to talk about the club, use Twitter with a hashtag [#ClubTheUnderground](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClubTheUnderground).

### Q. Can I upload photos/videos to Twitter etc?

A. You can freely upload photos (unless the performer said otherwise). 

If you want to upload videos, contact the performer yourself and ask for permission. For copyright reasons, it's safe to assume every video of a DJ set is not uploadable.

### Q. I noticed some people have a logo of the club in their avatar. How can I also use it?

A. The logo is published under the following license:

In a nutshell: You can change the color and place the glyphs ("地下 The Underground") as you like, but you are *not* allowed to edit the glyphs. Note that the ring part is not considered as a glyph.
